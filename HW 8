The ACE gene provides instructions to making the angiotensin-converting enzyme which plays a role in the system which regulates blood pressure and the balance of fluids and salts in the body. I would predict that removing this gene would give an individual an abnormal blood pressure as well as possible kidney failure (as the kidneys need salt and water absorption).
